# Development Environment

**This is optional! You can run `index.html` directly in browser. I use `gulp` only for auto refresh browser when coding**

You will need to install these tools first:
- NodeJS
- Gulp

Then, get the source from Github and run: 
```
npm install
```

To run live-reload server, run this command:
```
gulp serve
```

# Deploy to your host
You can deploy easily by upload all files and folders to your host.

`node_modules` folder are for development only, you can remove it when deploying.
